SMSmileys
=========

SMSmileys brings smileys to the default iPhone Messages app. It automatically replaces ascii smiley's like :) and :( with the emoji equivalent. 

Built with [THEOS](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos).

Tweak.m exists just so I had syntax highlighting in Xcode when I wrote it, maketweak.sh just backs up Tweak.xm, copies Tweak.m into Tweak.xm and builds it.
